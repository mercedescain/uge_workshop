Hi git is fun! Branching is great!

Labels Notes

o Head
o Master
  One free branch, but we can make more
o Branch
  Git branch git-notes (adds label git-notes to a commit)
  Prompt tells us what our active label is
  Git branch (checks which label)
  Git checkout (branch/label name) ((changes label))
    Diversion in timeline
