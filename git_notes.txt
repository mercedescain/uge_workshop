Hi git is fun! Branching is great!

Labels Notes

o Head
o Master
  One free branch, but we can make more
o Branch
  Git branch git-notes (adds label git-notes to a commit)
  Prompt tells us what our active label is
  Git branch (checks which label)
  Git checkout (branch/label name) ((changes label))
    Diversion in timeline

• GitHub
  o Create new repository
  o If you have repo on computer don’t check initialize with a readme (only if making one from scratch on github)
o Remote
  • Nickname for a url
  • Git remote add origin url
  • Git remote
       Tells you how many remotes you have
  • Git push
       Push to repo on github
       Push master branch
       -u
    • only need to do it once when you push
    • when you do git push next time you don’t have to specify where you’re pushing and pulling to as long as you’re on the master
